## What is a Database?
A **database** is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.  
It stores information in a structured way — usually in **tables** made up of **rows (records)** and **columns (fields)**.

### Example:
A *Student Database* might have a table like:

| Student_ID | Name     | Age | Course |
|-------------|----------|-----|--------|
| 101         | Nithin   | 20  | ISE    |
| 102         | Praphul  | 21  | CSE    |
